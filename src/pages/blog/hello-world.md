So this is what it’s like to blog with [Astro](https://astro.build), huh?

i’ll admit that this is all a little scary. i don’t really know what i’ll write about, or how often it’ll be. it just feels like it’s the soft of thing i should start doing more, now that i don’t have a regular job to spend my time at.

i’m doing this in an effort to address my recent burnout over the last 3-4 years. i’m hoping that this will help me get back into the habit of writing, and maybe even help me find some occasional work. i’m not sure if i’ll be able to keep this up, but i’m going to try.
